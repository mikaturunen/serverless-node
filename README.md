# Serverless node

Quick attempt at making a proof of a concept PaaS where one can easily deploy node scripts to be run and used. Roughly in the same manner as AWS Lambda works.

One of the key differences is that it'll probably result in creating a some sort of simplistic orchestration tooling for that and containers too.

I don't have a clear goal in my mind with the PoC but I'll tinker away with it and do a clearer README+writeup once it's in a potential stage.
